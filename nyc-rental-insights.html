				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>This report provides insights into the short-term rental market in New York City, aiming to assist
					Pillow Palooza, a start-up focused on short-term rentals, in identifying opportunities for growth
					and success. The analysis focuses on factors such as high revenue, popularity, and untapped supply.
					The average annual revenue for all rental types is $22,616, with entire homes or apartments
					generating the highest revenue at $40,991 per year. Manhattan stands out with the highest average
					annual revenue among boroughs at $38,115, while Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island fall below the
					average. The report recommends targeting neighborhoods that exceed the average annual revenue in the
					top 5% for each rental type, considering factors like neighborhood popularity, proximity to
					attractions, safety, and amenities.</p>

				<h2>Context</h2>

				<p>Pillow Palooza aims to disrupt the traditional real estate market by offering short-term rental
					options for travelers. To achieve this, insights into the New York City short-term rental market are
					essential. The main objective of this report is to provide valuable information to <b>maximize
						revenue</b>
					and <b>occupancy rates</b> for the company's short-term rental properties. To accomplish this, three
					key
					questions are addressed: which neighborhoods to invest in, which property types to focus on, and how
					to price rentals competitively in the market.
				</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pillow-palooza/pillow-pie-chart.png" alt="" /></span>The
					analysis begins
					by
					considering high revenue factors, using the metric of Annual Revenue,
					calculated by multiplying the number of days booked in a year by the price per day. The average
					annual revenue for all rental types is $29,510. Entire homes or apartments generate the highest
					revenue at $40,991 followed by private rooms at $17,111 and shared rooms at $9,746.</p>
				<p>
				<p>Shared rooms only account for 2.32% of the total data, while entire homes/apartments make up 52.64%
					and private rooms make up 45.04%. Given that annual revenue is more than double for entire
					apartments compared to private rooms, and there is limited data for shared rooms, the focus will be
					on targeting entire apartments.</p>
				<p>When examining average annual revenue by borough, Manhattan stands out with the highest average
					revenue of $38,115, nearly double the overall average of all boroughs. Brooklyn also performs well
					with an average of $26,685. However, Queens ($16,899), Bronx ($13,378), and Staten Island ($12,899)
					fall below the average.</p>
				<p>To identify neighborhoods for investment, the report focuses on the top 10% neighborhoods for the
					entire apartment rental type in the boroughs of Brooklyn and Manhattan. Median annual revenue per
					listing per neighborhood is used for this analysis to mitigate the impact of extreme rental prices.
				</p>

				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pillow-palooza/top_10_perc_neighbourhoods.png" alt="" /></span>

				<p>The graph shows the median annual revenue for the top 10 % of neighborhoods for the rental type:
					<b>Entire Apartment/house</b>, Boroughs: <b>Manhattan</b> and <b>Brooklyn</b>.
				</p>

				<p>The following neighborhoods are identified as top performers:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Sea Gate (Brooklyn) - Annual Revenue: $89,525</li>
					<li>Navy Yard (Brooklyn) - Annual Revenue: $98,475</li>
					<li>Tribeca (Manhattan) - Annual Revenue: $70,765</li>
					<li>Noho (Manhattan) - Annual Revenue: $65,700</li>
					<li>Civic Centre (Manhattan) - Annual Revenue: $64,170</li>
					<li>Soho (Manhattan) - Annual Revenue: $61,047</li>
					<li>West Village (Manhattan) - Annual Revenue: $58,820</li>
					<li>Nolita (Manhattan) - Annual Revenue: $58,400</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Next we consider the amount of listings available in the areas with high annual revenue.
					Our target areas can be identified as those which show potential with many available property
					listings, high occupancy and high revenue. These include
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>West Village
					<li>Soho</li>
					<li>Nolita</li>
					<li>Tribeca</li>
					<li>Noho
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Our potentially untapped areas show potential with high revenue, but there aren’t many listings
					available in these areas. Further analysis of the following areas is needed:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Civic Centre</li>
					<li>Navy Yard</li>
					<li>Sea Gate</li>

				</ul>

				<h2>Recommendation:</h2>

				<p>Based on the analysis, Pillow Palooza should consider investing in the neighborhoods identified as
					top performers for each rental type, as they demonstrate higher-than-average annual revenue
					potential. If only one rental type is chosen for initial focus, it would be entire apartments or
					houses. The boroughs, Manhattan and Brookly show the highest occupancy rate and revenue potential.
					The neighbourhoods, West Village, Soho, Nolita, Tribeca and Noho have enough data points to identify
					as top performers in the short rental market, whereas Civic Centre, Navy Yard and Sea Gate show
					promise as high revenue areas, but they don’t yet have many rentals available. It would be worth
					investigating if these areas are potentially untapped.</p>

				<p>Following these findings we should conduct further research and analysis specific to the target
					audience's preferences and needs to provide valuable insights for choosing which areas to invest in.
					Additional factors to consider for analysis include: neighbourhood popularity, proximity to
					attractions, safety, and amenities specific to the target audience. We will need to validate these
					findings by cross-referencing with external sources and conducting real-world experiments with a
					subset of properties.</p>

				<ol>
					<li><b>Neighbourhood Popularity:</b> Tribeca in Manhattan and Sea Gate in Brooklyn are highly
						popular among
						travellers due to their unique attractions, cultural experiences, and vibrant atmosphere, making
						them desirable destinations for short-term rentals.</li>
					<li><b>Proximity to Tourist Attractions or Business Centers:</b> Tribeca in Manhattan offers close
						proximity to popular tourist attractions like the Tribeca Film Festival, trendy restaurants, and
						upscale shopping areas, while Navy Yard in Brooklyn is near the thriving industrial park and
						cultural center of Brooklyn Navy Yard, making these neighborhoods attractive to both leisure and
						business travelers.
					</li>
					<li><b>Safety:</b> Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood and Brooklyn's Sea Gate, being a gated
						community, are
						known for their reputation of being safe and well-policed, providing potential guests with an
						added sense of security.</li>
					<li><b>Local Amenities:</b> Tribeca and Navy Yard boast a wide range of local amenities, including
						upscale
						dining options, boutique shopping, art galleries, and parks, enhancing the overall guest
						experience and making short-term rentals in these areas more appealing.</li>
					<li><b>Target Audience Preferences:</b> Different neighborhoods may align more closely with specific
						target
						audiences. For families, neighborhoods near parks, playgrounds, and family-friendly attractions
						would be desirable, while young professionals may prefer neighborhoods with a vibrant nightlife
						and proximity to trendy bars and restaurants.</li>
