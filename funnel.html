						previous" and "percent of top" metrics, and was separately created using SQL, Python, and
						Tableau for a
						comprehensive learning experience. The interactive Tableau funnel allows further filtering by
						granularity, metric, and age ranges. The findings are presented below in a
						final report and a short video.

					<h2 id="section1">Introduction</h2>
					<p>This project aims to analyze the customer funnel of Metrocar, a ride-sharing app (similar to
						Uber/Lyft), to identify areas for improvement and optimization. SQL was used for the initial
						data
						analysis, as well as aggregating the data to a user level, which could then be used in Tableau.
						Tableau was used for the visualisation of the funnel and other questions in our analysis. The
						stakeholders have asked several business questions that can uncover valuable insights for
						improving
						specific areas of the customer funnel.</p>

					<h2 id="section2">
						Summary
					</h2>


					<p>The analysis of Metrocar's customer funnel has provided valuable insights for optimization. The
						lowest conversion rate occurs between driver acceptance and completion of the ride steps
						(50.77%).
						Marketing efforts should focus on targeting iOS users (60.53% of app downloads). The largest
						identifiable age segment falls within the 35-44 age range, representing 21.95% of the total
						users.
						The 18-24 age group exhibits strong performance, while the 45-54 age group shows potential for
						improvement. Surge pricing during morning (8am-9am) and afternoon (4pm-5pm) spikes can
						effectively
						capitalise on peak demand.
					</p>

					<h2 id="section3">Metrocar's Funnel</h2>
					<p>
						The customer funnel for Metrocar includes the following stages:
					<ol>
						<li><b>App Download:</b> A user downloads the Metrocar app from the App Store or Google Play
							Store.
						</li>
						<li><b>Signup:</b> The user creates an account in the Metrocar app, including their name, email,
							phone
							number, and payment information.</li>
						<li><b>Request Ride:</b> The user opens the app and requests a ride by entering their pickup
							location,
							destination, and ride capacity (2 to 6 riders).</li>
						<li><b>Driver Acceptance:</b> A nearby driver receives the ride request and accepts the ride.
						</li>
						<li><b>Ride:</b> The driver arrives at the pickup location, and the user gets in the car and
							rides
							to their
							destination.</li>
						<li><b>Payment:</b> After the ride, the user is charged automatically through the app,and a
							receipt
							is sent
							to their email.</li>
						<li><b>Review:</b> The user is prompted to rate their driver and leave a review of their ride
							experience.
						</li>

					</ol>

					</p>

					<h2 id="section4">Business questions</h2>

					<p class="custom-text"> 1. What steps of the funnel should we research and
						improve? Are
						there any specific drop-off points
						preventing users from completing their first ride?</p>

					<p>Although improvements can be made at the sign-up and ride request point of the funnel, the
						biggest
						drop-off is observed after the driver has accepted the ride. Only 50.77% of accepted rides were
						completed. 74.65% of users downloading the app signed up and 70.40% of signed up users requested
						a
						ride.</p>

					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/funnel/user-funnel.png" alt="" /></span>


					<p class="custom-text">2. Metrocar currently supports 3 different platforms: ios, android, and web.
						To
						recommend where to
						focus our marketing budget for the upcoming year, what insights can we make based on the
						platform?
					</p>

					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/funnel/pie-chart-platform.png" alt="" /></span>Based
						on
						the platform distribution of Metrocar's app downloads, the following insights can guide
						marketing budget allocation for the upcoming year. Out of the total 23,607 downloads, iOS
						devices
						accounted for 60.53%, while Android devices represented 29.37% and web downloads only comprised
						10.09%.</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>Notably, the number of monthly downloads remained relatively consistent throughout the year.
						September had the highest number of iOS downloads (1,267), while Android downloads were lowest
						during that month. To optimise marketing efforts, it is recommended to prioritise targeting iOS
						users.</p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/funnel/line-graph-monthly-downloads.png" alt="" /></span>

					<p class="custom-text"> 3. What age groups perform best at each stage of our funnel? Which age
						group(s)
						likely contain our
						target customers?
					</p>

					<p>Before observing insights based on the age groups in each category it is important to note the
						age
						distribution among the users. Notably, the "None" category, which represents undisclosed or
						unknown
						ages, comprises 30.10% of the user base. The largest identifiable segment falls within the 35-44
						age
						range, representing 29.40% of the total users. The 25-34 age group closely follows with 19.56%.
						The
						18-24 and 45-54 age groups make up smaller proportions at 10.58% and 10.36%, respectively.
					</p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/funnel/bar-age-signup.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>There weren't obviously significant differences among the age groups for their conversion rates
						in
						the funnel. However, certain age ranges showed subtle variations in conversion rates at
						different
						funnel steps. Among the analyzed age groups, the 18-24 age group consistently performed well in
						several funnel steps. They had the highest conversion rates in the driver acceptance step
						(99.15%)
						and the completed ride step (51.98%). However, the same age group had the lowest conversion rate
						in
						the ride request step (69.71%), suggesting some room for improvement in that particular stage.
						<br><br>On the other hand, the 45-54 age group consistently showed lower conversion rates
						compared
						to other age groups. They had the lowest conversion rate in the driver acceptance step (98.6%)
						and
						the completed ride step (49.72%). However, they had the highest conversion rate in the completed
						review step (71.90%). Analysing the reviews could help identify reasons for the lower conversion
						rate in this age group.
					</p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/funnel/funnel-conversion-age.png" alt="" /></span>
					<i>The red blocks indicate the age group with the lowest conversion rate for that step and the
						yellow
						blocks indicate the highest conversion for that step.</i>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/funnel/funnel-pct-age.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>An analysis of the funnel indicates that users in the 35-44 age group achieved the highest
						percentage
						(25.71%) of reaching the end of the funnel, closely followed by the 18-24 age group (25.36%).
						These
						findings suggest that these two age groups performed the best in terms of funnel completion.</p>
					<p>Considering the size of each age group, it is likely that our target clients fall within the
						35-44
						age range. The differences in conversion rates and percent of top is very small and an A/B is
						recommended to identify its significance.</p>
					<p class="custom-text"> 4. Surge pricing is the practice of increasing the price of goods or
						services
						when there is the
						greatest demand for them. If we want to adopt a price-surging strategy, what does the
						distribution of ride requests look like throughout the day?</p>
					<p>Ride requests throughout the day exhibit two significant spikes: one between 8am and 10am and
						another
						between 4pm and 6pm. These spikes correspond to the morning and afternoon rush hours, indicating
						high demand during commuting times. After 6pm, ride requests gradually decrease until around
						8pm.
						Implementing surge pricing during the morning and afternoon spikes would effectively capture
						peak
						demand and maximise revenue. Consideration should be given to weekends, seasonal events, and
						special
						events that may further influence demand patterns.</p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/funnel/bar-ride-request-hour.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p class="custom-text">5. What part of our funnel has the lowest conversion rate? What can we do to
						improve this part of
						the funnel?</p>
					<p>The lowest conversion rate in our funnel occurs between the driver acceptance and completion of
						the
						ride steps, with a rate of 50.77%. This conversion remained low across all age groups and
						platforms.
						To improve this, we need to analyse the reasons behind the low conversion. Understanding whether
						users or drivers are cancelling rides is crucial. We could analyse the available review
						information
						for insights on potential issues. Additionally, examining the location and time of
						cancellations,
						app usability, and variations among different age groups can provide further ideas for
						improvement.
					</p>

					<h2 id="section5">Further Research</h2>

					<ol>
						<li>Improve the driver acceptance to completion of ride conversion: Analyse the reasons for
							cancellations and non-completions, considering user and driver behaviour. Analyse review
							data
							for insights and consider factors like location, time, app usability, and age group
							variations.
							Implement measures to address these issues and optimise the conversion rate in this stage.
						</li>
						<li>A/B the significance of the differences in conversion between age group. If significant,
							explore opportunities to increase sign up for the 18-24 age group and analyse reviews and
							insights from the 45-54 age group. Use these insights to optimise the user journey for this
							age
							group.</li>
						<li>Consider weekdays, weekends, and special events to further tailor surge pricing strategies
							and maximise revenue during high-demand periods.</li>
					</ol>

					<h2 id="section6">Immediate Recommendations</h2>

					<ol>
						<li>Set-up investigation for why rides only 50% of accepted rides are completed.</li>
						<li>Focus marketing budget on iOS.</li>
						<li>Focus marketing efforts on our biggest age group,35-44.</li>
						<li>Implement surge pricing during the morning (8am-10am) and afternoon (4pm-6pm) spikes,
							corresponding to peak demand during commuting times.</li>

					</ol>

					<p>By implementing these recommendations, Metrocar can optimise its customer funnel, target specific
						age
						groups, improve conversion rates, and maximise revenue through effective pricing strategies.</p>
