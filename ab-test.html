				<h2>Project Background</h2>

				<p></p>The e-commerce company Glowbox specializes in sourcing unique and high-quality prodects from
				around the world.
				<br><br>
				The company is primarily known amongst its customer base for boutique fashion items and high-end decor
				products. However, their food and drink offerings have grown tremendously in the last few months, and
				the company wants to bring awareness to this product category to increase revenue.
				<br><br>
				The Growth team decided to run an A/B test that highlights key products in the food and drink category
				as a banner at the top of the website.

				</p>

				<h2>Data Preparation</h2>
				<p>
					ETL in PostgreSQL: The dataset is stored in bi.io database
					The three tables were joined and only the necessary columns and rows were extracted on a user level
					using the query below:</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/glowbox/glowbox-sql-query.png" alt="" /></span>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<p>The goal of the test was to determine if the treatment had a statistically significant impact on the
					average spent per user and / or user conversion rate.

				</p>

				<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
				<p>Two hypotheses were formulated for both average spent per user and user conversion rate.</p>

				<h2>Test Users and Sample Selection</h2>
				<p>Randomly selected users from the website's traffic were included in the A/B test. Users who have
					previously participated in an A/B test on the website were excluded. The control group consisted of
					users who saw the existing website user interface with no banner, while the treatment group
					consisted of users who saw the updated website user interface with the food and drink banner.</p>
				<p>

				<h2>Sample Size Determination</h2>
				<p>The sample size should be large enough to detect meaningful differences in the metrics being
					measured. The control group had 24,343 users, the treatment group had 24,600 users, and the total
					users were 48,943.</p>

				<h2>Test Duration</h2>
				<p>The duration of the A/B test depended on the website's traffic and the expected effect size, which
					resulted in a total of 14 days.</p>

				<h2>Metrics</h2>
				<p>The metrics used in the A/B test were average spent per user, measured by mean, and user conversion
					rate, measured by proportion.</p>

				<h2>Statistical Method</h2>
				<p>Two-tailed t-test was used to compare the mean spent per user, and a two-tailed z-test was used to
					compare the conversion rate of the control and treatment groups. The level of significance (alpha)
					was set at 0.05 for both tests.</p>

				<h2>Set-Up</h2>
				<p>The experiment pertained to the mobile site only. Users saw either the current webpage or the webpage
					displaying a banner of the food and drink category.</p>

				<h2>Hypothesis Test - Average Spent Per User</h2>
				<p>To test the impact of the banner on the average amount spent per user, we conducted a hypothesis test
					using a two-tailed T-test to measure the average difference in means between the Control and
					Treatment groups. The significance level was set at 0.05 or 5%, and the confidence level was set at
					0.95 or 95%.
					<br><br>The mean for the Control group was found to be 3.375, with a standard error of 0.166. The
					mean
					for the Treatment group was 3.391, with a standard error of 0.162.
					<br><br>The critical value was found to be 1.960, and the confidence interval for the difference in
					means was calculated to be -0.4386 to 0.4713. The test-statistic was found to be 0.0704.
					<br><br>Based on our analysis, we conclude that the results of the hypothesis test were
					statistically
					insignificant. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the
					mean amount spent per user between the Control and Treatment groups.
				</p>

				<h2>Hypothesis Test - Conversion Rate</h2>
				<p2>We conducted another hypothesis test to determine whether there was a difference in conversion rates
					between the Control and Treatment groups. The null hypothesis stated that the conversion rates were
					the same, while the alternative hypothesis stated that they were different. The significance level
					was set at 0.05 and the confidence level was set at 0.95.
					<br><br>The conversion rate for the Control group was found to be 0.0392 with a standard error of
					0.0012, while the conversion rate for the Treatment group was 0.0463 with a standard error of
					0.0013. The difference in proportion was 0.007.
					<br><br>The critical value was found to be 1.9600, and the confidence interval for the difference in
					proportions using the pooled standard error was calculated to be 0.0035 to 0.0107. The pooled
					proportion test statistic was -3.864, and the proportion p-value was 0.000111.
					<br><br>Based on our analysis, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a
					significant
					difference in conversion rates between the Control and Treatment groups. We used a two-sample
					two-sided z-interval for a difference in proportions assuming equal proportions, and our results
					indicate that the Treatment group had a higher conversion rate than the Control group.
				</p2>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/glowbox/conversion-rate.png" alt="" /></span>
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>In conclusion, the A/B test conducted by the Growth and Engineering teams at Glowbox aimed to
					increase revenue and conversion rate by highlighting key products in the food and drink category on
					the mobile website. The test involved a control group and a treatment group, and two hypotheses were
					formulated for the average spent per user and user conversion rate. The statistical methods used
					were two-tailed t-test and z-test, and the level of significance was set at 0.05 for both tests.
					<br><br>The results of the hypothesis test for the average spent per user showed that there was no
					statistically significant difference between the Control and Treatment groups. However, for the user
					conversion rate, the test indicated a significant difference between the two groups, with the
					Treatment group having a higher conversion rate than the Control group.
					<br><br>Based on the findings, the Growth and Engineering teams at Glowbox can conclude that
					highlighting the food and drink category on the mobile website had a positive impact on user
					conversion rate, but no impact on the average amount spent per user. The teams can use these
					findings to make informed decisions and further optimize their mobile website to increase revenue
					and improve user experience.
					<br><br><b>Note:</b> Inferential statistics were performed using Python. For this project I
					challenged
					myself to code the statistical functions from scratch using the mathematical formulas, as opposed to
					relying solely on the scipy.stats library.
